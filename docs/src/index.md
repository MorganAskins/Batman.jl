# Batman.jl
The __B__ayesian __A__nalysis __T__oolkit for __M__onitoring 
__A__nti-__N__eutrinos, is a package designed to perform statistical
analysis on small datasets in a generic way. The user may decide the
type of analysis to be performed including the posterior and prior
probability distributions, all while naturally including nuisance
parameters (such as systematic uncertainties).
